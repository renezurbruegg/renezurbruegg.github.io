## About Me

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the ETH AI Center and part of the Robotic Systems Lab (RSL) and Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG). My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics and computer vision, with a focus on manipulation and embodied AI. I am particularly interested in developing data-driven control algorithms that enable robots to learn complex manipulation tasks from raw sensory data. I am also interested in scene understanding and representation learning for robotic perception. I am advised by Prof. Marco Hutter and Prof. Marc Pollefeys.

## Research Interests

- **Robotics:** Manipulation, Grasping, Active Perception, Embodied AI
- **Computer Vision:** Scene Understanding Representation Learning
- **Data Driven Control:** Reinfrocement Leraning, Sim-to-Real, Tactile Sensing, Imitation Learning
